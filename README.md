- run.py initializes the flask app and provides the context for it to run
- poetry new is used to create the folder structure initially and is then used to manage the dependencies
- requirements.txt is created as part of a pre-commit hook so that Docker can reconstruct the project dependencies with pip instead of having to bring in poetry during the build
- poetry is also used to provide a local virtual environment for testing
- The .gitignore keeps unnecessary Flask, pytest, VScode and Javascript build artifacts out of the repository
